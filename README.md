# Introduction to R 

This repository contains material for the Introduction to R session. The class is taught to first year PhD researchers at the SPS Department of the EUI who are enrolled in "Introduction to Quantitative Methods".

Before the session please do the following:

- Download and install [R](https://cran.stat.unipd.it) on your personal computer
- Download and install [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) on your personal computer

Optionally,

- Download and install the text editor [SublimeText3](https://www.sublimetext.com). 
- Open SublimeText and follow the instructions [here](http://unca-pols.org/2018/01/24/Day_02/) step-by-step. Notice that the procedure is different depending on whether you are a Windows or MacOS user. 

Because of time constraints, I will not be covering how to use R and SublimeText together, but if you are interested we can talk about it after the class. 


## Notes

The material for the class consists of two things:

- A tutorial with the [basics of the R lenguage](https://mebucca.github.io/Introduction-to-R/code/class_1.nb.html)

- A code template covering the essential functions incorporated in the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org) packages. The code has the structure of what I consider an effective and tidy workflow. It consists of a [masterfile](code/1_masterfile.R) from which we call different Rscript implementing different parts of the analysis (e.g. [data manipulation](code/2_exploration.R) and [data analysis](code/3_analyses.R)).
